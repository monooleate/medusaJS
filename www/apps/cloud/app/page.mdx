Welcome to the Cloud documentation. Learn about Cloud, its features, how to sign up, and how to use it.

## What is Cloud?

Cloud is Medusa's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering that facilitates deploying and operating your Medusa projects without having to worry about configuring, scaling, and maintaining its infrastructure and resources.

By using Cloud, you only need to focus on building your commerce application that meets your business requirements. Cloud provides a seamless developer experience with features like direct deployments from GitHub, instant preview environments, and more.

## Features

- **Direct deployments from GitHub**: Deploy your Medusa projects directly from your GitHub repository, and trigger deployments automatically on every push to the main branch.
- **Multiple Environments**: Create multiple environments for your projects, such as staging and production, to test changes before deploying them to production.
- **Instant Preview Environments**: Every time you open a Pull Request (PR) in your GitHub repository, a new preview environment is created where you can review changes before merging them.
- **Fully Managed Resources**: Cloud manages your project's resources like PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, and more. You don't have to worry about configuring and maintaining them.
- **Zero Downtime Deployments and Scalability**: Cloud rolls out changes to production with zero downtime, never interrupting your users. Cloud also automatically scales your project to meet peak traffic demands.
- **Logging**: Monitor your project's runtime and build logs for all environments, so you can easily debug issues in your project.
- **Dedicated Support**: Based on your plan, you can receive dedicated support from the Medusa team to help you with any issues you may encounter.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to learn about Medusa to use Cloud?

Since you deploy Medusa projects on Cloud, you need a developer who is familiar with Medusa to set up your project and add customizations for your business needs. Learn about Medusa in the [Getting Started](!docs!/learn) guide.

You can also contact a [Medusa Expert](https://medusajs.com/experts/) to help you with building your Medusa project and deploying it on Cloud.

### Does Cloud support hosting storefronts?

Cloud can only host Medusa servers and admin dashboards. To host your storefront, you can use hosting providers like Vercel.

{/* TODO Add link */}

Learn more about connecting your storefront to your Medusa server deployed on Cloud in the [Connecting Storefront](#) guide.

### What resources does Cloud provide?

Cloud provides fully-managed resources like PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, and more. You don't need to configure or maintain them.

{/* TODO Add link to resources guide */}

Learn more about the resources provided by Cloud in the [Resources](#) guide.

### Do I own my code and data for my Medusa project on Cloud?

Yes, your code is hosted on your GitHub repository. You can also export a dump of your Cloud database at any time.

### Can I deploy multiple projects on Cloud?

Yes, if your plan supports multiple projects. Contact our [sales team](https://medusajs.com/contact/) to learn more about the available plans.

### Can I use my custom plugins and modules on Cloud?

Yes, you can use any custom and out-of-the-box plugins and modules in your Medusa project deployed on Cloud. You retain the same flexibility as you would with a self-hosted Medusa project.

You can deploy projects like marketplaces, B2B, subscription-based stores, and more on Cloud.

### Does Cloud create new Medusa projects for each deployment?

No, Cloud does not create new Medusa projects for your deployments. Instead, it deploys your existing Medusa project from your GitHub repository.
